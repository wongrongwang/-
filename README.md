As a general rule, all forms of activity lead to boredom when they are performed on a routine(常规)basis. As a matter of fact, we can see this   principle   at work in people of all  ages  . For example, on Christmas morning, children are excited about  playing   with their new toys. But their  interest   soon wears off and by January those   same   toys can be found put away in the basement. The world is full of  well-organized  stamp albums and unfinished models, each standing as a monument to someone’s  broad  interest. When parents bring home a pet, their child  gladly  bathes it and brushes its fur. Within a short time, however, the  burden   of caring for the animal is handed over to the parents. Adolescents enter high school with great   excitement   but are soon looking forward to   graduation   . The same is true of the young adults going to college. And then, how many  adults  , who  now complain (抱怨) about the long drives to work,  eagerly  drove for hours at a time when they first   obtained   their driver’s license (执照)? Before people retire, they usually  plan  to do a lot of  great   things, which they never had  time   to do while working. But  soon   after retirement , the golfing, the fishing, the reading and all of the other pastimes become as boring as the jobs they  left   . And , like the child in January, they go searching for new  toys    .
