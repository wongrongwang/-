As a matter of fact, we can see this   principle   at work in people of all  ages  . For example, on Christmas morning, children are excited about  playing   with their new toys. But their  interest   soon wears off and by January those   same   toys can be found put away in the basement. The world is full of  well-organized  stamp albums and unfinished models, each standing as a monument to someone’s  broad  interest. Whenon wears off and by January those   same   toys can be found put away in the basement. The world is full of  well-organized  stamp albums and unfinished models, each standing as a monument to someone’s  broad  interest. When parents bring home a pet, their child  gladly  bathes it and brushes its fur. Within a short time, however, the  burden   of caring for the animal is handed over to the parents. Adolescents enter high school with great   excitement   but are soon looking forward to   graduation   . The same is true of the young adults going to college. And then, how many  adults  , who  now complain (抱怨) about the long drives to work,  eagerly  drove for hours at a time when they first   obtained   their driver’s license (执照)? Before people retire, they usually  plan  to do a lot of  great   things, which they never had  time   to do while working. But  soon   after retirement , the golfing, the fishing, the reading and all of the other pastimes become as boring as the jobs they  left   . And , like the child in January, they go searching for new  toys    .

 第二篇
                       Social networks are a big part of nearly every teenager's life in this day and age.Many teens have QQ,WeChat,or Weibo but little do a lot of teens know that they can be held responsible for everything they post for the rest of their lives.Everything you post online is part of a digital footprint that can always be traced (追踪)back to you.That includes every post,even every like,comment, favorite and forward that you have ever committed.All pictures you've posted or will post have been stored in a digital database,and it is the companies' right to keep all of these documents that you believe to have been deleted or hidden.

If you think you are safe from Servite finding out about one funny comment you made six months ago on a meaningless picture,you are probably wrong.Recently,a senior,Aaron,at Servite learned this lesson the hard way this year.He wrote a series of ugly comments towards Connelly girls on a web page,ignoring potential consequences.
This student,however,did have to face consequences from Servite as he was removed from all of his leadership roles in the school.Surprisingly enough,he fully agreed with the  punishment handed down by the administration and fully understood why he was given such severe punishment.
So,next time you're about to post something you think could be received as offensive or inappropriate,think twice,think again.
                                        
2. List


When I was a boy we used to live across the road from a big hill with huge oak trees growing out of it.When winter arrived,thick,heavy snow would fall,and my two brothers would grab their sleds heading over to the hill for a day of fun.I remember watching them with envy because I was still too small to go sledding.Finally,one winter I was considered big enough and joined my brothers as they carried their sleds up the long hill and prepared to ride down it.

The first few trips I rode with one of my brothers and had the time of my life.It was so exhilarating when the wind whipped across my face as I flew down the hillside on the wooden sled.Near the end of the day I was overjoyed too when my oldest brother decided to let me try riding the sled all by myself.I climbed on it full of excitement and lay on my stomach.Then with one big push my brother sent me down the snowy hillside.I was doing pretty well too until I hit an old stump hidden by the snow and went off course,straight towards one of those big oak trees.My heart pounded in my chest and I could hear myself screaming.At the last possible second I rolled off and the sled crashed into the tree.I could hear my brothers running down the hill yelling,“You have to steer（操控）! You have to steer!”

Sadly,that wasn’t the last time I failed to steer when some obstacle knocked me off course in my life.Many times problems,troubles,and my own failures have sent me crashing into the trees of anger,frustration,and despair.I am still learning that life isn’t always safe sledding.I am sti l learning that it is up to me to steer myself back to love,back to kindness,back to goodness,and back to God.

Life is a trip,but no one ever said it was a smooth ride.Steer well then.Steer straight.Steer your soul towards the light and the love we are all meant for.

Johannes Gutenberg was chosen to be the most important figure of the past millennium（千年）by the media. You may not be familiar with him.___16___Gutenberg is praised for having invented the printing press and therefore preparing the way for printing books.
He was born into a wealthy family in the city of Mainz,Germany.In 1428,he moved to Strasbourg and lived there for almost 20 years.___17___
Gutenberg used his skills in metalwork for the mass production of books.___18___That means that each copy of the Catholic Bible and all of its 73 books were painstakingly handwritten by penmen.Gutenberg fashioned a font（字体）of over 300 characters,far larger than the fonts of today.To make this possible,he invented the variable-width mold（模具）and perfected the mixture of materials used by type factories up to the present century.
___19___Between 1450 and 1455,while preparing to produce a large Latin Bible,Gutenberg is thought to have printed a number of smaller books,a calendar,and so on.The Bible of 42 Lines,the oldest surviving printed book in the Western world,was completed by August 15,1456.
The discovery of the modem printing press changed the way information was delivered.___20___
Even today in the computer age,we rely heavily on the printed word or text for instruction,information,and for the pleasure of reading literature.
A.Gutenberg made the world a much richer place.
B.But he has certainly influenced your life in some ways.
C.Gutenberg's idea was one of the greatest of all mankind.
D.By 1450,Gutenberg was back in Mainz at work on a printing press.
E.This invention was also responsible for educating the masses worldwide.
F.Before the spread of Gutenberg's idea,literature was primarily handwritten.
G.It was in Strasbourg that he probably made his first experiments with moveable type.
